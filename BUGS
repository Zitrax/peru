General meaning of priority

LOW:    Cosmetic things which can wait to the medium and high
        bugs are fixed. And wanted features.

MEDIUM: In general problems that makes the interface confusing
        to a user that not knows about the code (or one that does).

HIGH:   All that is actually an ERROR in the results, and all 
        SEGFAULTS goes here.
