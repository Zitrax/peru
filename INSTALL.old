OLD INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------

Compile and install opencv. Remember to specify something like -Wl,rpath,/path
to g++ if you are specifying --prefix to a path that are not in ld.so.conf.
OpenCV needs some additional programs, see it's INSTALL file.

Install qt3. (Using rpm's for redhat, install both qt and qt-devel). 

Descend into gui folder.
Check that the entries in Peru.pro are correct for your system. 
Run 'qmake Peru.pro'

Due to use of exceptions we have to make a change in the generated Makefile.
We remove the two occurrences of -fno-exceptions in the generated Makefile. 
This can easily be done by running the file fixmake in the gui folder if you 
have perl installed.

then run 'make' in the gui folder. 

When compiled, you can run the program with ./Peru

All in all: cd gui;qmake Peru.pro;fixmake;make;./Peru

PROBLEMS ?
----------

* See such that no old version of the libraries are used at runtime
  this can generate segmentation faults. ( Built with the new libs
  and runned with the old ) What ? Noo I did not do that ! ;)

* See that the angle and position of the calibration
  pattern is different enough, otherwise faulty calibration
  results will occur. For example using frames from 
  a videosequence where two frames next to each other
  in time are very similar. Even using for example five different 
  pattern and a sixth that is too similar to one of the first 
  five can give faulty results.

* OpenCV 0.9.3 has a 'bug' in highgui.h that should be fixed in the next version
  but if you use 0.9.3 you need to remove the line that redefines resize.
  OpenCV 0.9.4 change line in cv.h that includes "ipl.h" to <ipl/ipl.h>
  - The above errors does not apply to OpenCV >= 0.9.5
