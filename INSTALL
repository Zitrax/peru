PROJECT PERU
------------

This application provides functionality for generation of
disparity maps from stereo pairs of images and calibration of 
cameras. There is no manual available but hovering the mouse over 
most widgets will provide basic help.

This documentation is for version 0.4 and was last updated 2005-05-25

You will need the following installed on your computer:

REQUIREMENTS  
------------
OpenCV        Version: 0.9.6 (Beta 4)
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/
              http://www.intel.com/research/mrl/research/opencv/

Qt            Version: 3.1.1 ( Currently using 3.3.4 )
              http://www.trolltech.com/      


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

Compile and install opencv. If you install it to some other dir than the default by specifying a prefix you may have a look at INSTALL.old

Install qt3. (If using rpm's install both qt and qt-devel). 

Type 'make'.


PROBLEMS ?
----------

* See such that no old version of the libraries are used at runtime
  this can generate segmentation faults. ( Built with the new libs
  and runned with the old ) What ? Noo I did not do that ! ;)

* See that the angle and position of the calibration
  pattern is different enough, otherwise faulty calibration
  results will occur. For example using frames from 
  a videosequence where two frames next to each other
  in time are very similar. Even using for example five different 
  pattern and a sixth that is too similar to one of the first 
  five can give faulty results.

Still got problems? 

You can try the old procedure ( see INSTALL.old ).
