PROJECT PERU
------------

This application provides functionality for generation of
disparity maps from stereo pairs of images and calibration of 
cameras. There is no manual available but hovering the mouse over 
most widgets will provide basic help.

This documentation is for version 0.5 and was last updated 2006-10-17.

You will need the following installed on your computer:

REQUIREMENTS  
------------
OpenCV        Version: 0.9.6 (Beta 4)
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/
              http://www.intel.com/research/mrl/research/opencv/

              *************************************
              ** Note that versions > 0.9.6 will **
              ** _NOT_ work and support will     **
              ** probably not be added in the    **
              ** near future.                    **
              *************************************

Qt            Version: 3.1.1 ( Currently using 3.3.6 )
              http://www.trolltech.com/ 

              Qt 4 is not yet supported.     


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

Compile and install opencv. If you install it to some other dir than 
the default by specifying a prefix you may have a look at INSTALL.old

OpenCV might require ffmpeg. But as the compatible ffmpeg version is no
longer available at it's original location I will provide it at perus
projectpage as sourceforge. Get it from there if you need it. Note that
you get alot of errors if you use compilers newer than gcc 3.3, using
3.3 works fine for me. 

Install qt3. If using rpm's install both qt and qt-devel.
For debian based distributions you can install qt3-apps-dev
and qt3-dev-tools. 

Type 'make'.


PROBLEMS ?
----------

* See such that no old version of the libraries are used at runtime
  this can generate segmentation faults. ( Built with the new libs
  and executed with the old ) What ? Noo I did not do that ! ;)

* See that the angle and position of the calibration
  pattern is different enough, otherwise faulty calibration
  results will occur. For example using frames from 
  a videosequence where two frames next to each other
  in time are very similar. Even using for example five different 
  pattern and a sixth that is too similar to one of the first 
  five can give faulty results.

-----------------------------------------------------

Still got problems? 

You can try the old procedure ( see INSTALL.old ).

Or you can mail the author at daniel@bengtssons.info.
