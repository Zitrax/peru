PROJECT PERU
------------

This application provides functionality for generation of
disparity maps from stereo pairs of images. There is no manual
available but hovering the mouse over most widgets will
provide basic help.

You will need the following installed on your computer:

REQUIREMENTS  
------------
OpenCV        Version: 0.9.5  
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/
              http://www.intel.com/research/mrl/research/opencv/

Qt            Version: 3.1.1
              http://www.trolltech.com/      

ImageMagick   Version: 5.5.5 (Do not use earlier versions!)
              http://www.imagemagick.org/
              Newer versions (5.5.5+) has changed the height of label
              and thus ygap to drawCorners had to be modified.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

(The installation procedure is not tested thoroughly but should work in
 most cases. But beware of demons... )

Compile and install opencv. Remember to specify something like -Wl,rpath,/path
to g++ if you are specifying --prefix to a path that are not in ld.so.conf.
OpenCV needs some additional programs, see it's INSTALL file.

OpenCV 0.9.3 has a 'bug' in highgui.h that should be fixed in the next version
but if you use 0.9.3 you need to remove the line that redefines resize.

OpenCV 0.9.4 change line in cv.h that includes "ipl.h" to <ipl/ipl.h>

** The above errors does not apply to OpenCV 0.9.5 **

Install qt3. (Using rpm's for redhat, install both qt and qt-devel). 

Install ImageMagick. (I built 5.5.6 from source)

Descend into gui folder.
Check that the entries in Peru.pro are correct for your system. 
Run 'qmake Peru.pro'

Due to use of exceptions we have to make a change in the generated Makefile.
This is definitely going to be changed in later versions, but until now you 
have to manually remove the two occurrences of -fno-exceptions in the 
generated Makefile.

then run 'make' in the gui folder. 

When compiled, you can run the program with ./Peru

PROBLEMS ?
----------

* See so that no old version of the libraries are used at runtime
  this can generate segmentation faults. ( Built with the new libs
  and runned with the old ) What ? Noo I did not do that ! ;)
